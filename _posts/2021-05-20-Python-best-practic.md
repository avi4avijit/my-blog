## What is Coding Standard ?

A coding standard gives a uniform appearance to the codes written by different engineers. It improves readability, and maintainability of the code and it reduces complexity also. It helps in code reuse and helps to detect error easily. It promotes sound programming practices and increases efficiency of the programmers.

## Why Coding Standard is important?

It is important because they help to ensure safety, security, and reliability.
Coding rules and guidelines ensure that software is:

- Safe: It can be used without causing harm.
- Secure: It canâ€™t be hacked.
- Reliable: It functions as it should, every time.
- Testable: It can be tested at the code level.
- Maintainable: It can be maintained, even as your codebase grows.
- Portable: It works the same in every environment.

When developing code in PyCharm it will show underlying line indication if Style guide is not followed properly. If cursor is placed on that line it will show what is missing.

Here is the Guide from Python site which describe details. https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/
